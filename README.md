Feb 26 Changes:
- Rearanged the variables in the struct to be more visually pleasing and organized
- Renamed some variables to make them make more sense
- Reworked the entirity of the movement code because I just remembered that I could do it a way better way than before and I was being dumb
- Made and ate a grilled cheese, it was pretty good :D
- Reworked some collision and sprinting mechanics to better fit the new moving system
- Added vInput and hInput in the debug tool
